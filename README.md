# 📊 Loan Portfolio Risk & Exposure Dashboard

> A data-driven analysis of borrower default behavior and portfolio risk using SQL & Power BI.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project explores loan portfolio risk by analyzing borrower characteristics, credit behavior, and financial exposure.
The goal is to identify **high-risk segments, measure portfolio exposure, and support data-driven lending decisions.**

The dashboard simulates how financial institutions monitor risk and optimize credit strategies.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Measure overall portfolio default risk
* Identify high-risk borrower segments
* Analyze default trends across income and credit score bands
* Evaluate exposure at risk in the loan portfolio
* Enable data-driven credit decision-making

---

## 📌 Key Insights

✔ Low-income borrowers show consistently higher default rates
✔ Certain loan purposes (debt consolidation, medical) carry higher risk
✔ Credit score bands strongly influence default probability
✔ Portfolio exposure risk can be monitored using borrower segmentation
✔ Multi-factor analysis reveals risk patterns not visible in single metrics
